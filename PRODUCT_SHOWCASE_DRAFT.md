## 2. Core Features & Architecture

### 2.1 The Command Center (Dashboard)
The Dashboard is the first screen users see. It is engineered for "Zero-Click Latency" — all critical information is visible immediately without navigation.

*Real-time pulse of the global indices.*
*   **Feature:** Tracks major global indices (GIFT Nifty, Dow Jones, NASDAQ, DAX, Nikkei) in real-time.
*   **User Value:** Traders get an immediate specialized view of global sentiment before the Indian market opens.
*   **Visuals:** Color-coded heatmaps and sparklines for instant trend recognition.

### 2.2 The Economic Calendar (The Core USP)
This is not just a list of dates; it is the **strategic backbone** of the platform for Forex traders.

*   **Feature:** A highly detailed timeline of global economic events (fed rates, non-farm payrolls, RBI announcements, inflation data).
*   **Impact Analysis:** Each event is tagged with its potential impact level (High/Medium/Low) and the specific currency pairs/sectors it will affect.
*   **Consensus vs. Actual:** Displays the 'Forecast' vs. 'Actual' data points, allowing traders to trade the variance instantly.
*   **Smart Filtering:** Users can filter by country (USD, INR, EUR) or impact, ensuring they don't miss "Black Swan" events.
*   **User Value:** Fundamental analysis made accessible. Traders can plan their week around these volatility events.

### 2.3 The Forum & Community System
